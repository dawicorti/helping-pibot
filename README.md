## This is PiBot

PiBot is "robot" I built, really proud of it

... 

OK in fact this is just a head on wheel. But in my defense, I did not have much time to build it with my poor materials and tools.

Howerver.

Can you please help me ?

Great !

## Change the environment

All I ask you is to change the environment by __cloning__ __forking__ and __droping__ chunks on the environment to let my robot reach the teleporter.

Thank you stranger !

Next time I'll build a real robot ... if I'm not at the pub.
